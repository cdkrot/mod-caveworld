Hello once again.
This guide will walk you throught the beginning of the work with mod.

Installation
============
* Download and install minecraft 1.7 and a forge. Search for help on internet if needed.
* Download and install mod. Mod installs like any other, search on help guides if needed.


Launching
==============
* [SINGLE PLAYER:]
* Open client, press "single player" -> "create new world".
* Enter world name, change gamemode if needed, and then goto "more world options"
* Press on "world type" few times until you see "CAVE_WORLD".
* Press "create new world"
* [MULTI PLAYER:]
* For server: open a server.properties file and edit it:
* Replace line "level-type=.." to "level-type=CAVE_WORLD"
* Delete old world, or rename "level-name" in config.
* Launch server and play like usual.

In-game:
===========
* Wait until the world will generate. The cave-world is really high (from 0 block to 255, 256 total), it takes many time to generate.
* Now try to survive, i will not give you many spoilers, but at the beginning of the game stay high enough (~215-230 level) then when you will be ready go lower. But not before.


Updating:
==========
* Mode is in development now, it may update often, but be careful, when updating world generation may change. Artefacts on borders of old generated places and new can be noticeable.
